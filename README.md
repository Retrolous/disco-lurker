# disco-lurker

basic and clunky discord bot that allows you to explore your local music folder (sort of) like you would in a terminal and then queue songs to play. 

as this was only required for an album session with a friend, features such as seeking are absent, but could probably be easily added with ffmpeg arguments.

ffmpeg is required on your system, and accessible in your shell, for this to function.
