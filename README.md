# disco-lurker

basic and clunky discord bot that allows you to explore your local music folder (sort of) like you would in a terminal and then queue songs to play. 

as this was only required for an album session with a friend, features such as a "now playing" command with name and duration are not present, but that could probably be done using ffprobe. 

ffmpeg is required on your system, and accessible in your shell, for this to function.
